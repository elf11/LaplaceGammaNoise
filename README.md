# LaplaceGammaNoise

Functions to generate random noise either from a Laplace distribution (centralized way) or from a sum of N Gamma distributions. The results are quite similar, for the small sample that I've run:
Run #1
Laplace DP
10282.3
Gamma DP
10241.4

Run #2
Laplace DP
10126
Gamma DP
10241.4

Run #3
Laplace DP
10025.5
Gamma DP
10241.4
