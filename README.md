# LaplaceGammaNoise

Functions to generate random noise either from a Laplace distribution (centralized way) or from a sum of N Gamma distributions. The results are quite similar, for the small sample that I've run:
<br/>
Run #1 <br/>
Laplace DP
10282.3 <br/>
Gamma DP
10241.4
<br/>
Run #2 <br/>
Laplace DP
10126<br/>
Gamma DP
10241.4
<br/>
Run #3<br/>
Laplace DP
10025.5<br/>
Gamma DP
10241.4
